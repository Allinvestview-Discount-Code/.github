## 🚀 What is AllInvestView?

AllInvestView — found at allinvestview.com — is a professional portfolio management and investment analytics platform built for self-directed investors who want institutional-grade tools without the institutional price tag. Launched in early 2024 and designed with a global investor base in mind, AllInvestView consolidates every asset class a modern investor holds — stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, options, cryptocurrencies, and real estate — into a single unified dashboard that gives a complete, accurate, and analytically rich picture of net worth, portfolio performance, and risk exposure in one place.

What separates AllInvestView from every other portfolio tracker on the market is the depth of analytical tools it places in the hands of individual investors — tools that were previously available only inside hedge fund research platforms and Bloomberg terminals. Monte Carlo simulation projects thousands of possible portfolio outcomes based on current holdings and historical return distributions. Efficient Frontier analysis uses full Markowitz mean-variance optimisation to identify the portfolio allocation that maximises expected return for any given level of risk. Value at Risk calculation quantifies the worst-case downside at 95% and 99% confidence intervals before it happens. A correlation heatmap shows exactly how every asset in the portfolio moves in relation to every other, revealing hidden concentration risk that simple diversification metrics miss. Alongside these institutional-grade analytics, AllInvestView offers automatic broker sync to dozens of brokers including Interactive Brokers, Trading 212, DEGIRO, Charles Schwab, Revolut, Swissquote, Fidelity, Scalable Capital, and Trade Republic via Yodlee and SnapTrade integrations — plus CSV import with auto-detection for virtually any broker format — dividend tracking with safety scores, tax reports pre-built for 12+ countries, an AI assistant for portfolio questions and data visualisation, and full portfolio rebalancing tools. Registration is free, takes under 30 seconds, and requires no credit card — with Pro features accessible starting from the platform's paid tier and a Lifetime Deal option for investors who want permanent access without recurring subscription costs.

## 💼 Why Choose AllInvestView Over Other Portfolio Trackers?

AllInvestView has built a reputation as one of the most analytically deep, privacy-respecting, and asset-class-complete portfolio management platforms available to retail investors in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **Monte Carlo simulation — thousands of possible portfolio outcomes projected from current holdings** — AllInvestView's Monte Carlo engine runs thousands of simulated return scenarios based on current holdings, historical volatility, and return distributions to project the range of outcomes an investor might realistically experience over any chosen time horizon; rather than a single projected return line that hides all uncertainty, users see the full distribution of possible outcomes — including the downside scenarios that matter most for retirement planning, drawdown management, and risk-adjusted allocation decisions
- **Efficient Frontier with full Markowitz mean-variance optimisation** — the Efficient Frontier tool calculates the mathematically optimal portfolio allocation that maximises expected return for any given level of portfolio risk using Markowitz's mean-variance framework — the same methodology used by institutional fund managers and quantitative portfolio analysts; users can visualise exactly where their current portfolio sits relative to the optimal frontier and identify specific allocation changes that would improve the risk-reward balance without simply adding more risk
- **Value at Risk at 95% and 99% confidence intervals — know the worst-case before it happens** — AllInvestView calculates the statistical maximum loss the portfolio is likely to experience at 95% and 99% confidence levels over a defined time horizon, giving investors a quantified downside risk figure that is directly comparable across different allocation scenarios and time periods; this is a standard risk metric in professional portfolio management that virtually no competing retail portfolio tracker makes available to individual investors
- **Correlation heatmap — understand how every asset moves in relation to every other** — the colour-coded correlation heatmap shows the pairwise correlation between every asset in the portfolio, revealing concentration risk and hidden dependencies that a simple sector or geography allocation breakdown misses entirely; investors who believe their portfolio is diversified because it spans multiple sectors often find the correlation heatmap showing that positions which appear different on the surface move together under stress — the exact information needed to build genuinely diversified allocations
- **Automatic broker sync to 30+ major brokers including IBKR, DEGIRO, Fidelity, and Revolut** — AllInvestView connects automatically to dozens of brokerages including Interactive Brokers, Trading 212, DEGIRO, Charles Schwab, Revolut, Swissquote, Fidelity, Scalable Capital, and Trade Republic via secure Yodlee and SnapTrade read-only integrations that update holdings and transactions automatically every night without manual data entry; connections are read-only and secure by design — AllInvestView never has access to execute trades, and credentials never pass through AllInvestView's own servers
- **Smart CSV import with auto-detection for any broker format** — for brokers not covered by direct API connection, AllInvestView's smart CSV import detects the column structure of any exported transaction file and maps it automatically without requiring the user to manually specify which column contains which data field; combined with drag-and-drop file handling and a built-in library of templates for common brokers, this makes the initial portfolio setup one of the fastest in the market for investors coming from any brokerage background
- **Full asset class coverage including real estate, options, crypto, and bonds** — AllInvestView tracks stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, options, cryptocurrencies, real estate, mortgages, rental income, and cash assets in a single portfolio view; the real estate module tracks cap rate, NOI, cash-on-cash return, and property appreciation displayed alongside financial assets in the same net worth dashboard — a genuinely complete picture of total wealth rather than a partial view that stops at brokerage account boundaries
- **Dividend tracking with safety scores and income forecasting** — the dividend module tracks every expected dividend payment across all holdings, displays dividend safety scores that assess the financial sustainability of each payer's distribution, and forecasts future dividend income based on current holdings and historical payout patterns; for income-focused investors managing dividend portfolios, this is a materially more useful tool than the basic yield display that most competing trackers offer
- **Tax reports pre-built for 12+ countries** — AllInvestView generates tax reports formatted for the specific requirements of 12+ country tax authorities, covering capital gains, dividend income, and cost basis reporting in the format each jurisdiction requires; for international investors managing portfolios across multiple brokers in different countries, this eliminates the manual reconciliation and spreadsheet work that year-end tax preparation typically requires
- **AI assistant for portfolio questions and data visualisation** — AllInvestView's built-in AI assistant can import transactions, answer portfolio questions in plain language, and visualise specific data points on demand, allowing investors to interrogate their portfolio data conversationally rather than navigating menus to find specific metrics; verified reviewers describe using the AI assistant to identify specific risk concentrations and performance drivers without manually cross-referencing multiple analytics tabs
- **Benchmark comparison against VOO, SPY, or any custom index** — every holding and the full portfolio can be compared directly against VOO, SPY, or any other benchmark index to determine whether individual stock picks and the overall allocation are actually outperforming an equivalent passive strategy; for investors who believe active selection adds value, this benchmark comparison tool provides the honest, ongoing verdict that most portfolio trackers avoid displaying prominently
- **No ads, no third-party trackers, no data selling — complete privacy by design** — AllInvestView explicitly commits to zero advertising, zero third-party tracking scripts, and no sale or sharing of user data under any circumstances; the platform's privacy architecture ensures that financial data — the most sensitive personal data category — never flows to advertising networks, data brokers, or analytics platforms that monetise user behaviour, a commitment that competing tools funded by advertising revenue cannot make
- **Free to start with no credit card required — Pro and Lifetime Deal available** — AllInvestView offers a genuinely useful free tier with no credit card required at registration, giving investors the ability to evaluate the platform's analytics depth and interface quality before committing to a paid plan; the Pro tier unlocks the full institutional-grade analytics suite, and the Lifetime Deal option gives investors permanent access without any recurring subscription — an unusual and financially attractive option for long-term investors who want a one-time cost rather than a perpetual monthly charge

## 🔓 Reduce Your Startup Cost with INVEST

AllInvestView's Pro subscription is priced to make institutional-grade portfolio analytics accessible to individual investors at a fraction of what comparable tools cost in professional contexts — with a free starting tier that requires no credit card and a Lifetime Deal option for investors who prefer a single upfront payment over recurring monthly costs. With the discount code **INVEST**, you reduce that already accessible Pro plan cost by a further 20%, making it the most affordable legitimate entry to Monte Carlo simulation, Efficient Frontier optimisation, Value at Risk calculation, correlation heatmaps, automatic broker sync to 30+ institutions, dividend safety scoring, tax reports for 12+ countries, and an AI portfolio assistant available anywhere in the retail investment analytics market today.

At 20% off, the effective cost of accessing one of the most analytically complete portfolio management platforms available to individual investors drops to a level where the subscription pays for itself the first time the correlation heatmap reveals a concentration risk the investor was unaware of — or the first time the Monte Carlo simulation adjusts a retirement timeline assumption based on realistic outcome distributions rather than a single optimistic projected return.
